# Heart Disease Analysis

**Project Overview**

This repository contains the code and analysis for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the factors that contribute to heart disease and identify potential areas for further research.

---

## Dataset

Please replace `heart_disease.csv` with the actual path to your dataset file.

---

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and handle missing values.
   - Explore the basic structure and summary statistics.
   
2. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Analyze the distribution of key features.
   - Visualize continuous variables using histograms and boxplots.
   
3. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:**
   - Calculate correlations between variables.
   - Create scatter plots, heatmaps, and pairplots to visualize relationships.
   
4. **Target Variable Analysis:**
   - Examine the relationship between the target variable (e.g., presence of heart disease) and other features.
   
5. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Identify and visualize potential outliers.
   
6. **Conclusions and Next Steps:**
   - Summarize key findings and suggest areas for further analysis or feature engineering.
